<p>Crypto Clicker is a game I made with a friend (StuffingStuff) in our coding elective in high school. It is an idle game / incremental game created in idle game maker (created by the makers of Cookie Clicker). Like Cookie Clicker, the gameplay consists of getting a main currency from clicking, then buying items to do the clicking for you so you can buy more efficient items to get more currency (and repeat). The gameplay loops in on itself, and there is no real goal besides trying to get a lot of cookies (in Cookie Clicker) or money (in Crypto Clicker). Rather than buying factories and mines for cookies, you buy progressively more powerful hardware to mine progressively more valuable crypto currencies.</p>

<p>I would say both of us did a roughly equal amount of work. The pastebin with the game’s code is on my account but we had a shared google doc that we worked on and pasted on to the pastebin when we were ready. Writing the code itself wasn’t very difficult, as the framework for the game was already created. This freed us up to be able to mostly focus on brainstorming ideas for items and unlockables in the game.</p>

<p>This project taught me what building something in a framework is like. Before making this project, I had never worked with any sort of framework/engine. I learned how helpful it can be to work with others and not build things from scratch. Me and my friend both contributed ideas to this project and that was very helpful, as making all the ideas would be difficult for one person.</p>
