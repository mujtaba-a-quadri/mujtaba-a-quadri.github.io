  <h2 id="i-have-a-confession-to-make">I have a confession to make</h2>

<p>I thought coding standards were pretty much useless. I never used them in my code I wrote for myself, and I didn’t have to start using one until a class required it. it felt to me as if all it was doing was making code take twice as long to write (as I comb through it to make it adheres to the guidelines). It also wasn’t fun typing a single line and having my IDE scream bloody murder with the amount of warnings I’d recieve. It simply felt like needless busywork to me.</p>

<h2 id="but-then">But then…</h2>

<p>I started to actually have to work on other people’s code. All of a sudden, I’m reading files (not unlike the ones I wrote myself with no coding standard) which seem to have no rhyme or reason. One letter variable names all over the place, functions I cannot decipher due to 0 commenting, and files with a line count surpassing the current year. It was almost comical: how nonsensical code can look at first glance if not written neatly.</p>

<h2 id="now">Now…</h2>

<p>Well, it’s still true that following a coding standard certainly doesn’t make writing code faster. But the bit of extra time you put in on your end will save the next person reading that code (or even yourself, later) hours in trying to decipher what looks like gibberish. I definitely recognize the real benefits of implementing some sort of coding standard, especially for larger scale projects with many people collaborating, it seems almost necessary to stop everyone from accidentally ruining each other’s work.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-for-the-individual-coder">What about for the individual coder?</h2>

<p>While I think it is practically necessary and fully agreed upon to have a coding standard in place for code that others will read and maintain, it gets more blurry when someone is working alone. In this case, I think people would generally be more lax, even though it’s definitely still a real concern that your code will be illegible to yourself in a few months or years. I often am not very strict on coding standard when working alone, but the habits you pick up from following a coding standard will make your code generally more readable, even if you tend to ignore minute things like having extra blank lines where they needn’t be.</p>
