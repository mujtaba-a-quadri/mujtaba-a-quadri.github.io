  <h2 id="well-duh-you-say">“Well, duh”, you say</h2>

<p>Well I don’t think that the difficulties of UI design are apparent as an outsider looking in. You look at all these big name webpages and their websites look clean and sleek, without a blemish. It can’t be that hard right? I mean, you could probably mock up something very similar looking in photoshop in a few minutes.</p>

<p>But that overlooks a lot of the process behind a website, there’s a reason it “feels” sleek and clean, it’s been carefully made, remade, and refined. A lot of thought gets put into these abstract ideas that we can’t even really articulate. What does it mean for a website to “feel” clean, or “modern”? That’s not even mentioning things like color theory and making a website feel cohesive and intuitive to use. I mean, look at an HTML page with little to no css (or bad css), it’s hard to look at compared to the (usually) great websites we’re used to.</p>

<p>Fortunately (hopefully), most modern developers aren’t working with barebones HTML and CSS in order to make their magic work, they have the assistance of frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="in-comes-frameworks">In Comes Frameworks</h2>

<p>Frameworks are fantastic. They save an absurd amount of time you’d otherwise have to spend making classes that look half decent. And these come out of the box with very “modern” looking common parts of a website. For example, many sites have a footer, and without a framework you’d have to build the class for that from scratch. And not just you; <em>every</em> web developer would be doing the same thing, building their own footer class. And for what? Sure there’s value in things being written in different ways, but at the end of the day, these footers are going to look very similar. Having some sort of basis from a framework that you can modify to give its own identity saves <em>everyone</em> time.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-framework">The best framework?</h2>

<p>Here comes the opinion from someone who’s only used two frameworks: Twitter bootstrap and Semantic UI. Honestly, they’re quite similar and accomplish mostly the same thing, I think there’s little value in arguing over which one is better when both have about the same capabilities and take about the same amount of work to use (once proficient). Of course, there are real pros and cons to both frameworks, and those are valuable to know, just not to squabble and argue about.</p>

<p>Or maybe I’m oversimplifying… let’s hope my knowledge of the frameworks is deep enough to make this claim.</p>
